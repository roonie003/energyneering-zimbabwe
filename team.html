          <p>Qualifications: Electrical Projects Engineer (Electrical& Electronics), National Technical Diploma, Pretoria Technikon; Member of SAPVIA and Certified Schneider-Electric Solar Systems Integrator. With over 30 years of experience working with Eskom, Andre Anderson has established a very strong track record in the planning, construction and commissioning of major electrical infrastructure projects throughout Southern Africa. Andre provides an insight and understanding of how the industry works from an electrical connectivity viewpoint. Besides training and R&D, his role is to coordinate and manage the implementation, certification and connection from the solar arrays back to the power grid. He is currently assisting Eskom in developing the new NRS097 specification codes and is also a representative of SA (SABS) at SANS 10142 Solar PV Working Group. Andre is a qualified Electrical Projects Engineer with over 30 years' broad experience in the renewable energy fields. He has been involved with energy management projects since early 2000 and has completed extensive projects in solar and renewable energy. His experience includes design, implementation, monitoring and maintenance of renewable energy systems. He has worked with major industry role players such as Redefine Properties, Arrowhead Properties, ABSA Bank, Netelek, Rural Maintenance, Mafube Local Municipality and Eskom. After working out a baseline of ABSA's electricity consumption in 2010, a target was set to reduce energy usage by more than 12.5% from 2011 to 2013. Three hundred of the 1,000 ABSA facilities around the country implemented energy management systems to ensure their buildings become more energy efficient and produce better business results. The capital expenditure on this project was just under R50-million. More than 450 smart meters were installed to control electricity usage, and energy-efficiency was performed in collaboration with Eskom's integrated demand management programme.</p>
